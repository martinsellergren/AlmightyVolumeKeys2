        app:summary="When media is playing, volume keys change volume as usual. Otherwise, 5 quick volume clicks change volume, as well as a long-press." />

        app:title="Why are some actions unavailable on my device?"
        app:summary="It's possible more actions will be available if you update Android-version. Or maybe your device lacks the right hardware (for example, you can't turn on the flashlight if there is no flash). For sound recording, you need to install The Sound Recorder." />

        app:summary="Sure, just long click the notification and hide/ disable. (This notification is only there on some devices)." />

    <Preference
        app:title="Will this app use much battery?"
        app:summary="That depends on your user settings. Let me explain a little more. Normally a device falls asleep if you leave it with the screen off for a while, and when you turn the screen back on it wakes up. A sleeping device won't care about volume clicks, therefore this app prevents sleep. This means some additional battery consumption, mainly when you leave it for a long time, like over night. Therefore, if you find this troublesome you might wanna disable the app over night." />

    <Preference
        app:title="I need an action that isn't available, what to do?"
        app:summary="Try using the tasker-action (bottom of the list), Tasker can do lot's of stuff. Or, send me an email, perhaps I can add it." />
